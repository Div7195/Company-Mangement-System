# Comapany-Management-System
The Project was developed to update and add to the personnel data of a corporation for the 
ADMIN side. The Project also attempts to preserve the data and records of the softwares that the 
clients have acquired.
You are prompted to grant access in order to start the software when you initiate it. The program 
loads and stores the data from the pre-existing files. The information can then be viewed in 
accordance with the various sections, namely the information about the customers and the 
employees. The data can be accessed based on many criteria, such as name, department, 
employee code, customer ID. Additionally, fresh material can be inserted into already-existing 
files and can be modified and saved appropriately.
The program handles many kinds of potential exceptions. The information entered into the file is 
encrypted so that it cannot be read by a third party and stays encrypted.
